# AI-Powered Exercise Assistant üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This project is an **AI-based exercise correction tool** that uses **Mediapipe**, **OpenCV (cv2)**, and a **Neural Network** to help you perform exercises with proper form. By measuring angles between key body landmarks, it provides real-time feedback to ensure your movements are accurate. The frontend is powered by **Streamlit**, providing a simple and interactive interface.
